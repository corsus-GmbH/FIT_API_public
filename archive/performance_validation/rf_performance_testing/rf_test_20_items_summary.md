# 20 Random Items for Performance and Result Testing

This file contains 20 randomly selected items from the GET /items/ endpoint for performance and result testing between the original (port 8080) and refactored (port 8081) containers.

## Selection Method
- Used Python's random.sample() with seed=42 for reproducible results
- Selected from the complete items dataset (1,939 total items)
- Both endpoints return identical data for these items

## Data Files Created

1. **rf_test_20_items_original.json** - Items from original endpoint (port 8080)
2. **rf_test_20_items_refactored.json** - Items from refactored endpoint (port 8081)
3. **rf_random_20_items_original.json** - Full original response (1,939 items)
4. **rf_random_20_items_refactored_fixed.json** - Full refactored response (1,939 items)

## Validation Results

âœ… **Data Consistency Verified**
- All 20 items found in both endpoints
- Data identical between original and refactored endpoints
- Item counts match (20/20)

## Usage for Testing

These items can be used for:
1. Performance testing of GET /items/ endpoint
2. Input for POST /calculate-recipe/ endpoint testing
3. Baseline validation between container versions
4. Result consistency verification

## Next Steps

Use these item IDs as input for testing the POST /calculate-recipe/ endpoint to compare:
- Response times between containers
- Calculation result consistency
- API response structure validation
